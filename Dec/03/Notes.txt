Difference between server-side and client side code:
client side code runs on the browser, example of languages are HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
server side code runs on the server(high conf machine) and it needs language framework to run it. Example: Java, C#, Python, C, C++, PHP


What is web server?
It handles client requests, with the basic objective of the web server is to store,
process and deliver web pages to the users.
Examples: Apache, IIS (Internet Information Services)

Why do we need server side languages?
- to perform complex operations which is fast and efficient
- To make complex business logic to sit in between data and front end


Why PHP?
- This is just for simple demo on how database can be connected and accessed through a server-side langauge.
action="sample1.php" method="get"
