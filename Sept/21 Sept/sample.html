  The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] (About this
  soundlisten)) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris,
  France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed
  and built the tower. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron
  Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889
  World's Fair and was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists
  and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of
  France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel
  Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91
  million people ascended it in 2015. The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall,
  about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in
  Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During
  its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become
  the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years
  until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the
  first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark
  in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the
  tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17
  ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest
  free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has
  three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.
  The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the
  highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.
  Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second
  levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as
  is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase
  to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.
