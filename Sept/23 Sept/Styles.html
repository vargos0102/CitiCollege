        The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl]
        (About this soundlisten)) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ
        de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel,
        whose company designed and built the tower. Locally nicknamed "La dame
        de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889
        as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by
        some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but
        it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most
        recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most
        visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91 million people
        ascended it in 2015. The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the
        same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in
        Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.
        During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington
        Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title
        it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was
        finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass
        both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of
        a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller
        than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding
        transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing
        structure in France after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has three levels
        for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top
        level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest
        observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets
        can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second
        levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300
        steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although
        there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by
        lift.

        The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified
        Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is a series of
        fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of
        ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various
        nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from
        as early as the 7th century BC,[2] with selective stretches later joined
        together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
        Little of the Qin wall remains.[3] Later on, many successive dynasties
        built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most
        well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
        (1368–1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have
        included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods
        transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
        and the control of immigration and emigration.[4] Furthermore, the
        defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the
        construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations,
        signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact
        that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation
        corridor. The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple
        courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop
        Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north
        to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates
        the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning over 20,000 km (12,000 mi) in
        total.[5] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally
        recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in
        history.[6]
