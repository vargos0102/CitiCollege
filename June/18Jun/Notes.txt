Source Control (version control) - managing the changes in the code.
It also tracks the history.

Git - command lines that you execute to your files(add/update/delete)

GitHub - hosting(save) your own code centrally
Commit - binding/ making sure this is the file, I want to push
Push - Pushing my changes to the repository

commands(remember) 

git init (initialize)
git add helloworld.txt(only one file) or git add .(all files)
git commit -m "added Blog class"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rovinstanley/CitiCollege.git
git push -u origin master

git add .                     (track all the files that changed)
git commit -m "second commit" (message that needs to be shown)
git push                      (sync the changes now)
