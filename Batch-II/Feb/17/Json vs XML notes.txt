What are the advantages of using XML?
- It doesn't use any predefined tags. Author can define the tags and structure.
- you can add or remove tags as needed.
- It's widely adopted by most of the programming languages and have libraries to translate it.
- it's a recommended standard widely accepted by different platforms and channels.

Practical uses:
