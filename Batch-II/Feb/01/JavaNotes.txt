Server side programming languages
- Java
- C#
- Python  
- Nodejs

Reasons to choose Java
- works on all operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Open-source and free(conditional)
- popular & community support
- secure, fast and powerful

What is Intellij ?
It's a powerful IDE (integrated development environment).

What does it do?
It provides basic template and structure to code, so that you don't have to remember syntax.
It helps you with suggestion in syntax and makes compilation and running of programs easy.

What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine)?
JVM has main responsibility of converting your coded to bytes and allocate memory and generate intermediate code.


Build/ Compilation/Compiling your project
- It is checking for errors.

Run
- it is executing your program/ code.

Obejct Oriented Programming language.(Examples Java, C#, Python)
- Languages which follow certain principles comes under object oriented programming language.
1. Polymorphism
2. Abstraction
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance

- Something that can be described as an objects.

What is Main class & Main function?
- Starting point of code.

What is a Variable ?
Variable is a value given which will be used in the program.
Its containers for storing data values.

Data Types
- String : holds the letters, numbers and characters
- int (Integer): only whole numbers like 42,22,8899889.
- boolean: true or false values.
- char (Character): only a single value like letter, number or special character in single quotes. Example: 'A','F','!','5'
- float: holds the decimal value upto 7 digits. Example: 23.44f, 777.1234f
- double: holds the decimal value upto 15 digits. Example: 123.1234, 11.123456

Operators

Arithmetic Operators: - +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
Comparision Operators: ==, != , > , <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: || , &&

String functions 

length() : to find the length of a given string
concat() : to join one or more strings together
toLowerCase() : to make all letters lower case
toUpperCase() : to make all letters upper case
indexOf : Finds any character or string in a sentence
substring() : take out part of the string depending upon the index

Math Class

Math.min(): to find the minimum out of the two numbers
Math.max(): to find the maximum out of the two numbers
Math.sqrt(): to get the square root of a number
Math.abs(): absolute turns negative value to positive
Math.random(): give a random number in decimal less than 1


Booleans
value which is either true or false.

If..Else Statement/block
if(condition) { //execute code } else { // execute code }

if (condition) { } else if (condition) { } else { }

For Loop
execute a certain code for a number of times.
for (int i =0; i < 5; i++)
{
}

Arrays
they are used to store multiple values of same data type.
String[] names = {"Jack","Alter","John"}
int[] nums = {44,12,254}


Methods

Why Method?
To execute a certain code/ logic from different places inside the code.

What are parameters in the method?
Parameters is the information you pass to the method.
You need to mention the datatype that you are passing to the method.

For example: printMessage(String message), add(int x, int y)

What is Return Value from a method?
static void printMessage(String message){  }

static int add(int x, int y){  return x+y; }

Method Overloading:
You can create multiple methods with same name provided they have different method signatures.

a. number of parameters are different
b. the datatype of parameters

Scope:
You can not youe the same variable name within the same scope (method).


What is a Class?
- Blueprint (it is a structure that provide boudaries for an object.)

What is an Object?
- It's a reflection of a class and contains data through properties and methods.

What are class methods?
- the method which are part of the class itself and may use class attributes to perform operations.


What is a Constructor?
Constructor is a method inside a class which has exactly the same name as a class.
It's use to initialize a default value to class attributes.


Access Modifiers
- public : Makes attributes/class accessible outside class
- private: Makes attributes/class accessible only within the class
- protected: the attributes/class is accessible within the same package.
