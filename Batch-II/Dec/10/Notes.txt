Basic:
Your browser (IE/Edge/Chrome/Safari) understand only 3 things.
HTML/CSS/Javascript.


Javascript

What is Javscript?
- Javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive.
It's a programming language used for both client and server side programms.
It's currently one of the most popular languages. Mostly its used for client side rendering of
web pages.


Why do we need Javascript?
- Its needed to by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive expereince for the user.

HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

                          HTML
Head					Body
			h2		button 					p
		(Text:'Intro Page')  (Text:'Check D&T', Attr: 'onclick')      (Attr: 'id')


Difference between Java and Javascript?
- completely unrelated languages.
- same as C & C#

document.getElementbyId('')

Where the JavaScript is written?
- within the <script> </script>

Function: a set of statements that performs a task or perform any calculation.
Syntax: function funcName() { .. statements.. }
Call: funcName()

Output:
window.alert('') - to display or give a popup kind of a message on the browser.
window.print() - this just prints the html which you can see on the page.

Syntax:
Javascript Keywords: reserved keywords that means something to Javascript.
example: var 
JavaScript is case sensitive, example: firstName and FirstName.

JavaScript Variables: Variables are placeholders for value.
Example: var firstName = "John", var lastName ="Doe", var num1 = 76
--------------------------------------------
Javascript Operator: 
Arthimetic
+, -, *, /, % (Modulus), ++ (Increment), -- (decrement), =, += (assignment), **(exponentiation)

Coparision Operator:
> (greater than), < (less than), == (equal to), != (not equal), >= (greater than or eqaul to),
<= (less than or equal to)
---------------------------------------------
Data Types:
String - letters and numbers in double quotes. Example: "John", "$76.5", "Hello! 123".

null - empty/ nothing.
object - object contains one or more properties seperated by commas.
----------------------------------------------
Functions:
A JS function is a block or series of statements meant to do a particular task.
'return' is used to return the computed value from a function.
Functions can have any number of parameters as an input.
Example: function Add() { return 4+6; }
Example: function Add(num1, num2) { return num1+num2; }
-----------------------------------------------
Events:
Something has happened or occured. Gives JS opportunity to react to such events.
onclick(): example- when a button gets clicked.
onkeydown(): example- to block user from inputting numbers or special characters.
onchange(): example- when you change something in the text only then it gets fired.
onmouseover(): example- when you bring the mouse on html element it increases the font size.
onmouseout(): example- when you move the mouse out of the html element the font size is reset.
onload(): This event triggers when an object has been loaded. example- image start to load.
