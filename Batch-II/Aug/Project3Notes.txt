What is a State is?

Is this limited to only React applications?
- it may not be limited to React apps.


1. Heart of react component
2. Dynamic and interactive
3. It controls the behavior
4. it observes the properties and controls the behavior
5. State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation. It's managed in the component.

What is application state management and why do we need it?
- It manages the state of the entire application. It usually holds a central copy of Javascript object.

To update our state, we use this. setState() and pass in an object. This object will get merged with the current state. When the state has been updated, our component re-renders automatically.

What is redux?
- Redux is a central state container. It provides central store that holds the state of your application. 
Each component can access the stored state without sending it from one component to another.

To update our state, we use this. setState() and pass in an object. This object will get merged with the current state. When the state has been updated, our component re-renders automatically.
