Table Schema



Auto Increment:
Increasing the last value by one.

Null: Nothing or no data available


Querying the data -

SELECT * FROM studentdb.students

Sorting the data -

ORDER BY : sorting the result set by using ORDER BY clause
asc means ascending order (by default)
desc means descending order (you will need to specify this)

Filtering the data - 

- WHERE - filter rows based on specific condition

select * from studentdb.students where Email is not null
select * from studentdb.students where Email is null

Question: Get Names of the countries which do not have Independence Year. Sorted alphabatically.
Answer: SELECT Name FROM world.country Where IndepYear is null Order by Name

- AND - to form complex condition for filtering the data.
	With AND all the conditions must be true (fulfilled)

- OR - With OR one of the conditions must be true (fulfilled)

- IN - to determine if a value matches any value in the list.

- BETWEEN - to query based on the a range

- Like - to query based on a specific pattern
  % wild card matches any string of zero or more characters
  _ wildcard matches any single character

- LIMIT - use to limit the number of rows returned by select statement

- IS NULL - test whether a value is NULL or not by using IS NULL operator


Question: Get the names of the countries which got independence in the year 1950 to 1970 in the

Binary (B): stores binary strings, combination of 1 & 0's.
Unsigned (UN): non-negative numbers only.
Zero-Filled (ZF): fills up zero, ex: INT(5) 00004
Generated (G): value is generated by a formula based on the other columns
