Source Control (version control) - managing the changes in the code.
It also tracks the history.

Git - command lines that you execute to your files(add/update/delete)

GitHub - hosting(save) your own code centrally
Commit - binding/ making sure this is the file, I want to push
Push - Pushing my changes to the repository

commands(remember) 

git init (initialize)
git add helloworld.txt(only one file) or git add .(all files)
git commit -m "added Blog class"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rovinstanley/CitiCollege.git
git push -u origin master

git add .                     (track all the files that changed)
git commit -m "second commit" (message that needs to be shown)
git push                      (sync the changes now)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

github is your personal code store - you are keeping code.(Private)

Github ideally meant to store code for a team or share code across users.

Any code that needs to be worked together by the team of developers needs to 
be in public repository.

you would want to keep track of all the changes done by every developer.
--------------------

gitk - command to open the visual representation of the git tracking tree.

---------------------------------
branching and merging - One main branch and you create your own branch to work on it
separately.

merge - to merge back the to main or master branch.
