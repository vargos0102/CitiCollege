SERP - Search Engine Results Page

Video or multimedia: this will not be indexed by the search engine.

It is always advisable to put as many keywords as possible or description 

Sitewide links : it is a link which appears on most of your pages
For example: footer or your sidebar link

Why not to use Sitewide Links 
- When you create sitewide links GoogleBot is going to see the link on almost every page of the website. One or two site-wide links won't raise any suspicion but if you're going to abuse this feature, most likely Google will place it under the unnatural links category.

There are often times when you link other website from your own website.
- not a good practice from SEO standpoint
